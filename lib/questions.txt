Avoid using other ruby collections (Arrays, Hashes, etc) for the storage of your
beats. That’s where you’re supposed to use the linked list. But having Arrays
elsewhere in your code, or using methods that return arrays (like .split) are
totally ok.
# But Joshua in his video is using array for a LinkedList project
# Explanation of Ruby Sitepoint (link provided) is also using array
